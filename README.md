# Automated-time-table-generating-application


# Introduction #

* Here we have to generate an automated time table generating application considering an educational institute for two academic years using the given inputs.



# Guide to use the system #

* In this code there are 4 classes as lecturer, year, lecture hall and course. And there we store the inputs given by the csv files as objects. In this code we need to give the .csv files as inputs and get the timetable as the output. Also, we have to assign lecture halls for each course by considering the capacity of the lecture. The time table is generating here using a simple program.

* At the beginning of the program we have a selection pane and we can select one option from two. If we need to see the academic details, we can choose 1 and If we need to generate the timetable, we can select the option 2.

* When we consider about the algorithm we have used here, it is a kind of algorithm made by us. Basically, here we have assigned the courses to the different time slots and checked the constrains given in the guide line.
